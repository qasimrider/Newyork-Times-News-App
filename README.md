## Dtos
This is providing the binding capabilities to the UI layer in order to show the data. This is kind of the bridge between Repositories and business module with out having cyclic dependency.This module dont have any dependency from the application
###### Purpose
1. Displaying the Actual data to the UI layer

## buildSrc 
A special module within the project to manage dependencies and whatnot.



## Test cases
The following test cases were performed
1. NewsRepositoryTest - Repository Test
2. GetMostViewedNewsTest - Use case Test
3. FakeNewsList - Fragment Navigation Test
